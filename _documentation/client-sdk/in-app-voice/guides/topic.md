# How to do Something

Guides contain task-oriented material (How to...) that is not suitable for a tutorial. Usually it is how to do a specific, well-defined thing, for example, how to make a call.

Tutorials are for much longer use cases that potentially require multiple products (for example Messages API, VAPI and Conversation Service).
